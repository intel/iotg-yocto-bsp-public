Subject: [PATCH] drm/i915/bxt: Allow PSR use

From a quick skim of the spec, I don't see any indication that PSR needs
to be programmed differently on BXT than it is on SKL/KBL, so it looks
like it may be safe to add BXT to the HAS_PSR() platform list.  PSR will
still be disabled by default, but can now be turned on by setting the
'i915.enable_psr' kernel parameter.

Manually tested with igt/kms_psr_sink_crc in non-CRC mode and most of
the tests seem to work as expected.
