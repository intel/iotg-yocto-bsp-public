Subject: [PATCH 35/46] drm/i915: Watchdog timeout: Disable on RCS for now

We suspect that RCS reset by GuC following watchdog timeout is missing
some important state restore. There is no known user at the moment who
will be intentionally opting in for RCS watchdog but let's make sure
that no one accidentally does.
