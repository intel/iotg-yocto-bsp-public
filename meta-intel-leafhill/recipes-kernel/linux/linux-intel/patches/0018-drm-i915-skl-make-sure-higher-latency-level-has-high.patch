Subject: [PATCH 18/46] drm/i915/skl+: make sure higher latency level has
 higher wm value

DDB allocation optimization algorithm requires/assumes ddb allocation for
any memory C-state level DDB value to be as high as level below the
current level. Render decompression requires level WM to be as high as
wm level-0. This patch fulfils both the requirements.

v2: Changed plane_num to plane_id in skl_compute_wm_levels

v3: Addressed review comments from Shashank Sharma
Changed the commit message "statement can be more clear,
"DDB value to be as high as level below " what is level below ?"

v4: Added reviewed by tag from Shashank Sharma

v5: Added reviewed by from Juha-Pekka Heikkila

v6: Rebased the series
